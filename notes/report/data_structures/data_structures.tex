\section{Basic Data Structures}
\label{sec:BasicDataStructures}

``[A list is a] container of variable length , and [a tuple is a] container [of] fixed length'' \cite[\S4.3 pp. 111]{Tate2010}.

A list (in {\it Prolog}) can be deconstructed into $[${\it Head} $|$ {\it Tail}$]$, where {\it Head} refers to the first element of the list and {\it Tail} refers to the rest of the list; on the other hand, tuples cannot be similarly deconstructed \cite[\S4.3 pp. 113]{Tate2010}.

\section{Graphs}
\label{sec:Graphs}

A graph $G$ is an ordered pair, $G = (V,E)$, of a vertex/node set and an edge set.

Types of finite graphs: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item undirected graph: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item simple graph, or undirected simple finite graph: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Does not allow multiple edges (or, parallel edges, or multi-edges) between any pair of vertices/nodes in the graph, nor (self-)loops.
		\item Symmetric loopless directed graph
		\item Therefore, the edges of a simple graph form a set, as opposed to multigraphs that have multisets of edges.
		\item An edge is a two-element subset of $V$; other graphs (i.e., hypergraphs) can have edges with more than two nodes.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item multigraph: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item A multigraph allows multiple edges (or, parallel edges, or multi-edges) to exist between any pair of vertices (or, nodes) in the graph. Alternatively, for any pair of vertices (or, nodes) in the multigraph, they allow multiple edges to be incident to them.
		\item pseudograph: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item Some authors/people use pseudographs and multigraphs interchangeably/synonymously.
			\item Other people use pseudographs to refer to multigraphs that allow self-loops (or loops).
			\end{enumerate}
		\item A planar graph remains planar, or preserves its planarity, when its edges become multiple edges by the addition of edges to edges in the original graph.
		\item Representations for different types of multigraphs: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item undirected multigraph, which edges have no identity, is an ordered pair (or 2-tuple) $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), $E$ is a multi-set of undirected edges (or unordered pairs of vertices).
			\item undirected multigraph, which edges have an identity each (or, where each edge has an identity), is an ordered triple (or 3-tuple) $G = (V, E, r)$, such that $r: E \rightarrow \{\{x, y\} : x, y \in V\}$ is a function that assigns each edge to an unordered pair of vertices (i.e., endpoint nodes).
			\item directed multigraph (or multidigraph), which edges have no identity, is an ordered pair (or 2-tuple) $G = (V,E)$. Here, $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), and $E$ is a multi-set of ordered pairs of vertices (i.e., directed edges, directed arcs, or arrows)
			\item A mixed multigraph is a(n) (ordered) 3-tuple $G = (V, E, A)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), $E$ is a set of undirected edges, and $A$ is a multi-set of directed edges/arcs.
			\item A directed multigraph (or multidigraph), which edges have an identity each (or, where each edge has an identity), is a 4-tuple $G = (V, E, s, t)$. Here, $V$ is a set of vertices (or nodes), $E$ is a multi-set of ordered pairs of vertices (i.e., directed edges, directed arcs, or arrows), $s : E \rightarrow V$ so that each edge is assigned to its source node, and $t : E \rightarrow V$ so that each edge is assigned to its destination/target node.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item A labeled multigraph is a 6-tuple $G = (\sum_{V}, \sum_{E}, V, E, l_{V}, l_{E})$. Here, $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), and $E$ is a multi-set of ordered pairs of vertices (i.e., directed edges, directed arcs, or arrows), $\sum_{V}$ is the finite alphabet of available vertex labels, $\sum_{E}$ is the finite alphabet of available edge labels, $l_{V} : V \rightarrow \sum_{V}$ is a map describing the labeling of the vertices, and $l_{E} : E \rightarrow \sum_{E}$ is a map describing the labeling of the vertices.
		\item A labeled multidigraph is also known as a labeled, directed multigraph. It is a 8-tuple $G = (\sum_{V}, \sum_{E}, V, E, s, t, l_{V}, l_{E})$. Here, $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), and $E$ is a multi-set of ordered pairs of vertices (i.e., directed edges, directed arcs, or arrows), $\sum_{V}$ is the finite alphabet of available vertex labels, $\sum_{E}$ is the finite alphabet of available edge labels, $s : E \rightarrow V$ so that each edge is assigned to its source node (or, is a map that assigns each edge to its source node), $t : E \rightarrow V$ so that each edge is assigned to its destination/target node (or, is a map that assigns each edge to its destination/target node), $l_{V} : V \rightarrow \sum_{V}$ is a map describing the labeling of the vertices, and $l_{E} : E \rightarrow \sum_{E}$ is a map describing the labeling of the vertices.

\subsection{Graph Representations}
\label{ssec:GraphRepresentations}

Focus on sparse graph representations, which are common in modeling digital integrated circuits and neural networks (certain types), and dense graphs (e.g., neural networks). \\

For sparse graphs, use list or map -based graph representations for better memory efficiency. \\

For dense graphs, use matrix-based graph representation for faster access time at the expense of worse member efficiency; see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_graph}. Also, see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_subgraph} regarding dense subgraphs. \\

Hence, there exists a trade-off between access time and member efficiency in graph representations.\\

The ways to represent graphs are listed as follows: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item adjacency matrix: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item 
	\end{enumerate}
\item adjacency list: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item 
	\end{enumerate}
\item adjacency map: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item 
	\end{enumerate}
\item edge list: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item Is this equivalent to the ``incidence list'' graph representation? {\Huge Cite this!!!}
	\item 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
