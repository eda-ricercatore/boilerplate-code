\section{Basic Data Structures}
\label{sec:BasicDataStructures}

``[A list is a] container of variable length , and [a tuple is a] container [of] fixed length'' \cite[\S4.3 pp. 111]{Tate2010}.

A list (in {\it Prolog}) can be deconstructed into $[${\it Head} $|$ {\it Tail}$]$, where {\it Head} refers to the first element of the list and {\it Tail} refers to the rest of the list; on the other hand, tuples cannot be similarly deconstructed \cite[\S4.3 pp. 113]{Tate2010}.

\section{Graphs}
\label{sec:Graphs}

Types of graphs: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item undirected graph: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item simple graph: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item Does not allow multiple edges nor loops.
		\item Therefore, the edges of a simple graph forma  set, as opposed to multiple graphs.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{enumerate}
\item directed graph: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Graph Representations}
\label{ssec:GraphRepresentations}

The ways to represent graphs are listed as follows: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item adjacency matrix: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item 
	\end{enumerate}
\item adjacency list: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item 
	\end{enumerate}
\item adjacency map: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item 
	\end{enumerate}
\item edge list: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
