\section{Graphs}
\label{sec:Graphs}

A {\bf graph} $G$ is an ordered pair, $G = (V,E)$, of a vertex/node set and an edge set \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a38}.

Types of {\bf finite graphs} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a38}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item {\bf undirected graph} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a38}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item {\bf simple graph}, or {\bf undirected simple finite graph} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a38}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
		\item Does not allow {\bf multiple edges} (or, {\bf parallel edges}, or {\bf multi-edges}) between any pair of vertices/nodes in the graph, nor {\bf (self-)loops}.
		\item A {\bf symmetric loopless directed graph} is a graph that has an edge $(v_{2}, v_{1})$ for each edge $(v_{1}, v_{2})$, and it does not contain any self-loops (i.e., edges $v_{i}, v_{i}, \forall i \in V$).
		\item Therefore, the edges of a simple graph form a set, as opposed to multigraphs that have multisets of edges.
		\item An edge is a two-element subset of $V$; other graphs (i.e., hypergraphs) can have edges with more than two nodes.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item {\bf multigraph} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a39}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} %\itemsep -1pt
		\item A {\bf multigraph} allows {\bf multiple edges} (or, {\bf parallel edges}, or {\bf multi-edges}) to exist between any pair of vertices (or, nodes) in the graph. Alternatively, for any pair of vertices (or, nodes) in the multigraph, they allow multiple edges to be incident to them \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a39}.
		\item {\bf pseudograph} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a39}: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
			\item Some authors/people use pseudographs and multigraphs interchangeably/synonymously.
			\item Other people use pseudographs to refer to multigraphs that allow self-loops (or loops) \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a13}.
			\end{itemize}
		\item A {\bf planar graph} remains planar, or preserves its planarity, when its edges become multiple edges by the addition of edges to edges in the original graph {\Huge Reference this!!!}.
		\item Representations for different types of {\bf multigraphs} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a39}: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
			\item A {\bf multidigraph} is also known as {\bf quiver} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a40}.
			\item {\bf undirected multigraph, which edges have no identity}, is an ordered pair (or 2-tuple) $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), $E$ is a multi-set of undirected edges (or unordered pairs of vertices).
			\item {\bf undirected multigraph, which edges have an identity each (or, where each edge has an identity)}, is an ordered triple (or 3-tuple) $G = (V, E, r)$, such that $r: E \rightarrow \{\{x, y\} : x, y \in V\}$ is a function that assigns each edge to an unordered pair of vertices (i.e., endpoint nodes).
			\item {\bf directed multigraph (or multidigraph or quiver), which edges have no identity}, is an ordered pair (or 2-tuple) $G = (V,E)$. Here, $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), and $E$ is a multi-set of ordered pairs of vertices (i.e., directed edges, directed arcs, or arrows)
			\item A {\bf mixed multigraph} is a(n) (ordered) 3-tuple $G = (V, E, A)$, where $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), $E$ is a set of undirected edges, and $A$ is a multi-set of directed edges/arcs.
			\item A {\bf directed multigraph (or multidigraph or quiver), which edges have an identity each (or, where each edge has an identity)}, is a 4-tuple $G = (V, E, s, t)$. Here, $V$ is a set of vertices (or nodes), $E$ is a multi-set of ordered pairs of vertices (i.e., directed edges, directed arcs, or arrows), $s : E \rightarrow V$ so that each edge is assigned to its source node, and $t : E \rightarrow V$ so that each edge is assigned to its destination/target node.
			\end{itemize}
		\item A {\bf labeled multigraph} is a 6-tuple $G = (\sum_{V}, \sum_{E}, V, E, l_{V}, l_{E})$. Here, $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), and $E$ is a multi-set of ordered pairs of vertices (i.e., directed edges, directed arcs, or arrows), $\sum_{V}$ is the finite alphabet of available vertex labels, $\sum_{E}$ is the finite alphabet of available edge labels, $l_{V} : V \rightarrow \sum_{V}$ is a map describing the labeling of the vertices, and $l_{E} : E \rightarrow \sum_{E}$ is a map describing the labeling of the vertices.
		\item A {\bf labeled multidigraph} is also known as a {\bf labeled, directed multigraph}. It is a 8-tuple $G = (\sum_{V}, \sum_{E}, V, E, s, t, l_{V}, l_{E})$. Here, $V$ is a set of vertices (or, nodes), and $E$ is a multi-set of ordered pairs of vertices (i.e., directed edges, directed arcs, or arrows), $\sum_{V}$ is the finite alphabet of available vertex labels, $\sum_{E}$ is the finite alphabet of available edge labels, $s : E \rightarrow V$ so that each edge is assigned to its source node (or, is a map that assigns each edge to its source node), $t : E \rightarrow V$ so that each edge is assigned to its destination/target node (or, is a map that assigns each edge to its destination/target node), $l_{V} : V \rightarrow \sum_{V}$ is a map describing the labeling of the vertices, and $l_{E} : E \rightarrow \sum_{E}$ is a map describing the labeling of the vertices.

			\begin{itemize} 
			\item Such visualizations are known as {\bf planar embeddings of the graph}, or {\bf plane graphs} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a43}.
			\item A planar embedding of a planar graph $G_{P} = (V_{P}, E_{P})$ is a mapping of vertices $v_{i} \in V_{P} = \{v_{1}, \dots, v_{n}\}, \forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\},$ to points on a plane, and a mapping of edges $e_{j} \in E_{P} = \{e_{1}, \dots, e_{m}\}, \forall j \in \{1, \dots, m\},$ to plane curves on that plane, such that no planar curve intersects another planar curve and planar curves are connected at points in that plane \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a43}.

	\item {\bf dipole graph}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item A {\bf dipole graph} (or {\bf bond graph} -- not that kind of {\bf bond graph}) has a set of only two vertices, and a set of (parallel) edges between these vertices.: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt

			\end{itemize}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item A {\bf dual graph} $H = \{V_{H}, E_{H}\}$ of a planar graph $G = \{V_{G}, E_{G}\}$ \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a43} is a graph that maps each vertex $v_{i} \in V_{G} = \{v_{1}, \dots, v_{n}\}, \forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\}, n \geq 3,$ to each face of $H$, and maps each vertex $v_{j} \in V_{H} = \{v_{1}, \dots, v_{m}\}, \forall j \in \{1, \dots, m\},$ to a face in $G$, and each edge $e_{k} \in E_{H} = \{e_{1}, \dots, e_{o}\}, \forall k \in \{1, \dots, o\},$ connects adjacent faces of $G$ that are separated by an edge. Hence, each edge $e_{l} \in E_{G} = \{e_{1}, \dots, e_{p}\}, \forall l \in \{1, \dots, p\},$ corresponds to a dual edge $e_{k}$ in $H$, such that the endpoints of $e_{k}$ are the dual vertices corresponding to faces on both sides of $e_{l}$ \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a48}. \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item The definition of $H$ depends on the planar embedding of $G$, since the duality property is a property of the planar embedding (as opposed to planar graphs that can be embedded, but its embedding is not known yet) \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a48}.
		\item Hence, a planar graph can have multiple dual graphs, since it can have multiple planar embeddings \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a48}.
		\item ``The property of being a dual graph is symmetric,'' such ``that if $H$ is the dual of a connected graph $G$ [(the primal graph)], then $G$ is [also] a dual of $H$'' \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a48}.
		\item 
		\end{enumerate}
	\item A {\bf bouquet grap} $B_{m}$ ``is an undirected graph with one vertex and $m$'' self-loops \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a47}. That is, each edge in the undirected graph  $B_{m}$ is a self-loop \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a13}.

	\item Notes about vertices/nodes: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} %\itemsep -1pt
		\item If the graph contains an edge connecting vertices $u$ and $v$, $e = (u, v)$, the vertices $u$ and $v$ are {\bf adjacent} to each other \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a11}.
		\item The {\bf degree (or valency) of vertex} $v$, which is denoted by $\delta(v)$ (or, ${\rm deg}(v)$ or ${\rm deg}\ v$), is the number of edges that are incident to $v$ \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a11,WikipediaContributors2018a37}.: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
			\item Regarding undirected graphs, the degree of a vertex $\deg(v)$ is equal to the number of edges (i.e., $n$) \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a13}; i.e., $\deg(v) = n$.
			\end{itemize}
		\item An {\bf isolated vertex} is a vertex with degree zero, $\delta(v) = 0$. It is not an endpoint of any edge; or, no edge in a (or, any) graph is defined with an isolated vertex \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a37,WikipediaContributors2017a11}.
		\item A {\bf leaf vertex}, {\bf end vertex}, or {\bf pendent vertex}, is a vertex of degree one, $\delta(v) = 1$, and is an endpoint of only one edge ({\bf pendent edge}) in the graph \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a37,WikipediaContributors2017a11}.
		\item A {\bf dominating vertex} is ``a vertex with degree $\delta(v) = (n - 1)$ in a graph of $n$ vertices'' \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a37}.
		\item For a vertex $v$ of a directed graph, the {\bf outdegree} of $v$ (denoted by $\delta^{+}(v)$) is its number of outgoing edges, and the {\bf indegree} of $v$ (denoted by $\delta^{-}(v)$) is its number of incoming edges. A {\bf source vertex} is a vertex with a zero indegree ($\delta^{-}(v) = 0$), and a {\bf sink vertex} is a vertex with a zero outdegree ($\delta^{+}(v) = 0$) \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a11}.
		\item A vertex $v$, which has no incident edges apart from a(n) (undirected) loop from $v$ to itself, has a degree of two; i.e., ${\rm deg}(v) = 2$ \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a37}. \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{itemize} \itemsep -1pt
			\item ``A {\bf loop}, {\bf self-loop}, or {\bf buckle}, is an edge that connects a vertex to itself'' \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a13}.
			\item Regarding undirected graphs, the degree of a vertex with a loop and no other incident edges is two; i.e., $\deg(v) = 2$ \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a13}.
			\item Regarding undirected graphs, a vertex with a loop and no other incident edges has an indegree of one $\delta^{-}(v) = 1$ and an outdegree of one $\delta^{+}(v) = 1$ \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a13}.
			\end{itemize}
		\item For a graph $G$, its {\bf maximum degree} $\Delta(G)$ and its {\bf minimum degree} $\delta(G)$ are the maximum and minimum degree of its vertices \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a37}.
		\item A {\bf cut vertex} is a vertex that would disconnect the graph when it is removed \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a11}.
		\item A {\bf vertex cut} $S$ (or, {\bf vertex separator}, or {\bf separating set}) is a {\bf vertex subset} ($S \subset V$) for non-adjacent vertices (or subgraphs \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a44}) $a$ and $b$, if the removal of the {\bf vertex cut} $S$  disconnects/separates the subgraphs ``$a$ and $b$ into distinct connected components'' \cite{WikipediaContributors2016n}.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item An {\bf independent set} is a set of vertices $S$ such that no pair vertices $(v_{i}, v_{j}), \forall i \forall j \in V, V = \{v_{1}, \dots, v_{n}\}$ has an edge connecting them \cite{WikipediaContributors2017a11,WikipediaContributors2018a45}. %\vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} %\itemsep -2pt
		\item That is, there does not exist any edge $\not\exists e = (v_{i}, v_{j}), \forall i \forall j \in V, V = \{v_{1}, \dots, v_{n}\}$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item The handshaking lemma \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a46,WikipediaContributors2018a37} states that the number of vertices with odd degree in any undirected graph $G = (V, E)$ is even. $\displaystyle\sum_{v \in V} \deg(v) = 2|E|$.
	\end{enumerate}
\item A {\bf subgraph} $S = (V_{S}, E_{S})$ of a graph $G = (V_{G}, E_{G})$ is another graph that includes a subset of the vertices and edges of $G$, such that $S \neq G, S \not\subset G, V_{S} \subset V_{G}, E_{S} \subset E_{G}$, and $(S \cap G) = S$ \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a44}.
\item {\bf Multi-dimensional networks}: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item {\bf Multi-dimensional networks} belong to type of {\bf multi-layer networks} that have multiple types/kinds of relations \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a42}.
	\item A {\bf multi-dimensional network} can be modeled with a {\bf multipartite edge-labeled multigraph} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a41,WikipediaContributors2018a42}.
	\item An {\bf unweighted multi-layer network} can be represented as a triple $G = (V, E, D)$, where (or, in which) $V$ is a set of vertices, $E$ is a dimension-specific set of edges connecting the vertices and each edge is represented by the triple $(u, v, d)$ such that $u, v, \in V$ and $d \in D$ (or, $E = \{(u, v, d); u, v \in V, d \in D$), and $D$ is a set of dimensions or layers \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a42}. %\vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} %\itemsep -2pt
		\item For an {\bf unweighted, undirected multi-layer network}, the edges/links $(u, v, d)$ and $(v, u, d)$ are equivalent.
		\item For an {\bf unweighted, directed multi-layer network}, the edges/links $(u, v, d)$ and $(v, u, d)$ are different/distinct.
		\item By convention, {\bf unweighted multi-layer network} are not {\bf multigraphs} in a given dimension; hence, ``the number of $[$edges/$]$links between two nodes in a given dimension is either zero or one''. ``However, the total number of $[$edges/$]$links between two nodes across all dimensions is less than or equal to $| D |$.''
		\end{enumerate}
	\item An edge of a {\bf weighted multi-layer network} can be represented as a 4-tuple (or, quadruplet) $e = (u, v, d, w)$, ``where $w$ is the weight of the $[$edge/$]$link between $[$vertex$]$ $u$ and $[$vertex$]$ $v$ in the dimension $d$'' \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a42} %\vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} %\itemsep -2pt
		\item {\bf Weighted multi-layer networks}, like {\bf unweighted multi-layer networks}, can also be represented as a triple $G = (V, E, D)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of edges (each edge is represented by $e = (u, v, d, w)$), or $E = \{(u, v, d, w); u, v \in V, d \in D, w \in W\}$, $W$ is a set of weights, and $D$ is a set of dimensions or layers.
		\item A {\bf weighted multi-layer networks}, where an edge is defined as $e = (u, v, d_{1}, \dots, d_{n}, w)$, such that $d_{1}, \dots, d_{n} \in D$, can model {\bf multidimensional temporal networks}, or {\bf multidimensional time-varying networks} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a42}.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Multidimensional network} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a42}: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_network}.
	\item {\bf Multipartite graph} \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a41}: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipartite_graph}
	\item {\bf Temporal network}, or {\bf time-varying network}: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_network}
	\item A {\bf 1-dimensional (1-D) network} has a {\bf 2-dimensional (2-D) adjacency matrix} with the size $V \times V$; $A^{i}_{j}$ is an adjacency matrix that encodes edges/links/connections between vertices $i$ and $j$.
	\item For a {\bf multi-dimensional network} with $| D |$ dimensions, it has a {\bf multi-layer adjacency tensor (or, 4-dimensional matrix, or 4-D matrix)} with the size $(V \times D) \times (V \times D)$; $M^{i\alpha}_{j\beta}$ is an {\bf multi-layer adjacency tensor} that encodes edges/links/connections between vertices $i$ in layer $\alpha$ and $j$ in layer $\beta$ \cite{WikipediaContributors2018a42}.

\item {\bf extremal graphs}: \vspace{-0.3cm}
	\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
	\item ``{\bf Extremal graph theory} studies {\bf extremal (maximal or minimal) graphs} which satisfy a certain property. Extremality can be taken with respect to different graph invariants, such as order, size or girth.''

\subsection{Graph Representations}
\label{ssec:GraphRepresentations}

Focus on {\bf sparse graph representations}, which are common in modeling digital integrated circuits and neural networks (certain types), and {\bf dense graphs} (e.g., neural networks). \\

For {\bf sparse graphs}, use {\bf list or map -based graph representations} for better {\bf memory efficiency}. \\

For {\bf dense graphs}, use {\bf matrix-based graph representation} for faster {\bf access time} at the expense of worse {\bf member efficiency}; see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_graph}. Also, see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dense_subgraph} regarding dense subgraphs. \\

Hence, there exists a {\bf trade-off between access time and member efficiency in graph representations}.\\
