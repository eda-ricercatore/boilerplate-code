	\item \cite{Heller2003}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item The {\tt put} pointer points ``to the next free byte in the {\tt stringstream}.'' That is, it ``holds the address of the next byte in the output area of the'' {\tt stringstream}. When the {\tt stringstream} is empty, the {\tt put} pointer points to the beginning of the {\tt stringstream} buffer. \cite[\S9.8]{Heller2003}.
		\item ``The type of the {\tt put} pointer'' does not matter to the software developer(s), since they ``cannot access it directly'' \cite[\S9.8]{Heller2003}.
		\item ``The {\tt get} pointer holds the address of the next byte in the input area of the stream, or the next byte we get if we use $>>$ to read data from the {\tt stringstream}'' \cite[\S9.9]{Heller2003}.
		\item ``The {\tt end} pointer indicates the end of the {\tt stringstream}. Attempting to read anything at or after this position will cause the read to fail because there is nothing else to read'' \cite[\S9.9]{Heller2003}.
		\item Developers only have to know about how {\tt put}, {\tt get}, and {\tt end} pointers work. They do not have to know the actual representation of these pointers \cite[\S9.9]{Heller2003}.
		\item The {\tt stringstream} object acts as a buffer, and is ``an area of allocated memory'' (``by the stringstream member functions'') \cite[\S9.9]{Heller2003}.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item \cite{McMahon20XY}: \vspace{-0.2cm}
		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item C strings (or C-strings, or C-style strings) are null-terminated strings (arrays of characters that each end with a terminating ``null character'' with ASCII value 0) and are arrays of characters; the ``null character'' is usually represented by the literal character '$\backslash$0'. ``However, an array of {\tt char} is NOT by itself a C string.''
		\item ``Since {\tt char} is a built-in data type, no header file is required to create a C string. The C library header file $<${\tt cstring}$>$ contains a number of utility functions that operate on C strings.''
		\item ``It is also possible to declare a C string as a pointer to a {\tt char}: char$^{\ast}$ s3 = ``hello''; '' It creates a character array with just enough memory space (in the heap) to store the null-terminated string. The address of the string's first character is placed in the {\tt char} pointer {\it s3}. When this improperly used, it can corrupt program memory or cause run-time errors.
		\item ``[Use] the {\tt C} library function {\tt strlen()}'' to determine ``the length of a {\tt C} string.'' It returns an unsigned integer representing the number of characters in the string, excluding the terminating null character.
		\item Relational operators (such as $==, !=, >, <, >=, <=$) compare the addresses of the first characters in the two string operands (as the array names are treated as pointers), instead of the contents of these strings.
		\item ``Use the {\tt C} library function {\tt strcmp()}'' ``to compare the contents of two {\tt C} strings.'' The input arguments of this function are two pointers to {\tt C} strings.
		\item ``Use the {\tt C} library function {\tt strcpy()}'' to assign a string to a C string or change its contents. The {\tt strcpy()} function accepts a pointer to the C string as the first input argument, and a pointer to the contents of a valid C string or string literal (i.e., a character) as the second input argument. The {\tt C} library function {\tt strcat()} has the same input arguments as {\tt strcpy()}, and is used for concatenating two strings.
		\item C strings can be used as input parameters or the return type. They are specified as {\tt char[]} or {\tt char$^{\ast}$}.
		\item ``A {\tt C++} string is an object of the class string, which is defined in the header file $<$string$>$ and which is in the standard namespace.'' The variable name of a {\tt C++} string is a pointer to the first character of the string; the variable name contains the address of the string's first character. The {\tt C++} string is a dynamically-allocated array of characters.
		\item ``[Use] the string class methods {\tt length()} or {\tt size()}'' to determine ``the length of the {\tt C++} strings.''
		\item To improve memory efficiency and reduce memory usage, explicitly {\it pass a string object}. Else, the {\tt C++} string objects are pass and returned by value, which involves making a copy of the string object.
		\item Concatenate C++ strings, C strings, and string literals in any order using the ``+'' operator.
		\item Convert a C++ string into a C string via the {\tt c\_str()} function of the {\tt string} class. The {\tt c\_str()} function returns a pointer to the array of characters representing the string. If the C++ string is not null-terminated, a null character is appended to the new C string. The returned C string ``can be used, printed, copied, etc.'' but not be modified.
		\item Since programming with arrays can enbug the code more easily, the use of C++ {string} is (strongly) recommended for use. This is because the properties of a2
		\item When a C string is required by a function, convert the C++ string into a C string (as aforementioned). Instances in which a C string have to be converted into a C++ string are: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item Strings passed into {\tt main()} as C strings from the command line argument.
			\item Functions for file input/output operations require filenames to be specified as C strings.
			\item The C++ string class does not have the equivalent functions of certain C string library functions.
			\item Unlike C++ strings, C strings can be serialized in binary format without requiring a bunch of extra code to be written.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item The function {\tt atoi} converts a string to an integer. Similar functions for converting strings into numbers are: {\tt atol} and {\tt atof}. The C++ STL does not have a {\tt itoa} function to convert a number to an integer. However, some compilers supports this function in the {\it C Standard General Utilities Library}.

		\item Static buffers (via {\it atoi()}, {\it sprintf()}, or {\it sscanf()} from the {\it $<$stdio.h$>$}) for type conversions can cause buffer overflow and do not provide adequate type safety (i.e., adequate type checking mechanism). This can be mitigated via {\it stringstreams}.

		\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -2pt
		\item \cite{Moses2016} recommends including the implementation file ({\tt .cpp}), instead of the header file ({\tt .hpp}) in any {\it C++} file that uses the {\it C++} template.
		\item \cite{Ben2013} argues for separating the {\it C++} template definitions in the header file ({\tt .hpp}) from the {\it C++} template implementations in the implementation file ({\tt .cpp}).
		\item ``Although standard C++ has no such requirement, some compilers require that all function and class templates need to be made available in every translation unit they are used. In effect, for those compilers, the bodies of template functions must be made available in a header file. To repeat: that means those compilers won't allow them to be defined in non-header files such as .cpp files.\dots\ There is an export keyword which is supposed to mitigate this problem, but it's nowhere close to being portable.'' \cite{Gogolev2009}
		\item \cite{Benoit2009} argues that you can merge the definition and implementation in a single file, which ends with the {\tt .hpp} file extension.
		\item \cite{DevSolar2009,Diago2013} argue that both the definition and the implementation of {\it C++} templates should be placed together in the {\it C++} header file, with white space 
		\item This is a list of different implementations of a C++ template: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item Implemented with {\it C++} template definition and implementation in one file, where the definition and implementation are clearly separated/distinguished/demarcated. The implementation is appended to the end of the definition, with some white space to separate them \cite{Gogolev2009,DevSolar2009,Diago2013}.
			\item Implemented with merged {\it C++} template definition and implementation in one file \cite{Benoit2009}.
			\item Implemented with {\it C++} template definition and implementation separately in different files: a {\it C++} header file and a {\it C++} implementation file. Any file that uses this {\it C++} template will have to import the {\it C++} implementation file, instead of the {\it C++} header file \cite{Moses2016,Ben2013}. {\color{red}\tt I shall use this method. This clearly decouples the {\it C++} template definition and implementation separately into different files, and keeps things modular in my software architecture. It prevents templates from being huge monoliths.}

			\item ``A reference is a variable that refers to something else and can be used as an alias for that something else. A pointer is a variable that stores a memory address, for the purpose of acting as an alias to what is stored at that address. So, a pointer is a reference, but a reference is not necessarily a pointer. Pointers are a particular implementation of the concept of a reference, and the term tends to be used only for languages that give you direct access to the memory address. References can be implemented internally in a language using pointers, or using some other mechanism.'' Answer from dan1111.
			\item ``Passing an object by value means making a copy of it. You can modify that copy without affecting the original. Making that copy can cost a lot of memory access though. Passing an object by reference means passing a handle to that object. This is cheaper because you don't need to make a copy. It also means that any changes you make will affect the original.'' Answer from Steve Rowe.
			\item ``There is no such thing as a null reference. A reference must always refer to some object. As a result, if you have a variable whose purpose is to refer to another object, but it is possible that there might not be an object to refer to, you should make the variable a pointer, because then you can set it to null. On the other hand, if the variable must always refer to an object, i.e., if your design does not allow for the possibility that the variable is null, you should probably make the variable a reference.'' Answer from Harssh S. Shrivastava.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item A pointer is dereferenced via the explicit $^{\ast}$ operator. The $^{\ast}$ operator should not be used to dereference a reference (variable) \cite{Saks2001}.
		\item \cite{Saks2001}: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item int $^{\ast}$pi = {\&}i; // Indirect expression to dereference $pi$ to $i$. ``Declare $pi$ as an object of type `pointer to int' whose initial value is the address of object $i$'' \cite{Saks2001a}.
			\item int {\&}ri = i; // $ri$ is dereferenced to refer to $i$. ``Declares $ri$ as an object of type `reference to int' referring to $i$'' \cite{Saks2001a}.
			\item The {\it C++} standard does not dictate how compilers shall implement references. However, popular compilers tend to implement references as pointers. Therefore, there are no significant advantages of using references or pointers.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item \cite{Saks2001a}: \vspace{-0.1cm}
			\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -1pt
			\item ``A valid reference must refer to an object; a pointer need not. A pointer, even a const pointer, can have a null value. A null pointer doesn't point to anything.''
			\item I can bind a reference to a null pointer, but I cannot dereference a null pointer since it can ``produce undefined behavior''.
			\end{enumerate}
		\item You cannot call a non-const method from a const method. That would 'discard' the const qualifier.: \vspace{-0.1cm}

	\item With shallow copying, I would only copy the memory references or pointers. The copy and the original reference the same object. On the other hand, with deep copying, I would copy the values; this is also known as cloning. The copy and the original reference do not share objects; each of them references its own object. The default copy constructor carries out shallow copy.

To conclude, we can get some facts about each data structure: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item {\tt std::list} is very very slow to iterate through the collection due to its very poor spatial locality.
\item {\tt std::vector} and {\tt std::deque} perform always faster than {\tt std::list} with very small data
\item {\tt std::list} handles very well large elements
\item {\tt std::deque} performs better than a {\tt std::vector} for inserting at random positions (especially at the front, which is constant time)
\item {\tt std::deque} and {\tt std::vector} do not support very well data types with high cost of copy/assignment
\end{enumerate}



This draws simple conclusions on the usage of each data structure \cite{Bulka2000,Josuttis1999a}: \vspace{-0.3cm}
\begin{enumerate} \itemsep -4pt
\item Number crunching: use std::vector or std::deque
\item Linear search: use std::vector or std::deque
\item Random Insert/Remove:
\item Small data size: use std::vector
\item Large element size: use std::list (unless if intended principally for searching)
\item Non-trivial data type: use std::list unless you need the container especially for searching. But for multiple modifications of the container, it will be very slow.
\item Push to front: use std::deque or std::list
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Alternate Computer Number System for Representing Fractions in C++}
\label{ssec:AlternateComputerNumberSystemforRepresentingFractionsInCpp}

	An alternate computer number system for representing fractions in C++ is the fixed-point number system. For a detailed classification of computer number systems, see \cite{Lu2004}. \\

	In {\it C++}, the numerical data types are based on cardinal numbers (e.g., one, two, three, \dots), instead of ordinal numbers/integers (e.g., first, second, third, \dots); see \cite{DictionaryDotComStaff2016,WolframResearchStaff2016,Pierce2016} for the definitions of ``cardinal number'' and ``ordinal number.'' From \cite{Pierce2016}, ``a Nominal Number is a number used only as a name, or to identify something (not as an actual value or position).'' E.g., ``the number on the back of a footballer (``8''),'' ``a postal code (``91210''),'' and ``a model number (``380'').'' \\

\subsection{Using ``Design By Contract''}
\label{ssec:UsingDesignByContract}

	The ``Design By Contract'' approach shall be used in software development. This approach is also known as: ``contract programming, programming by contract, and design-by-contract programming.'' Adhere strongly to Hoare logic. \\

	That is, at the start of an implementation of a ({\it C++}) function, check that its precondition(s) is (/are) met; preconditions shall be chosen to be as weak as possible. Within the implementation of the function, check if the assertions (properties that must be true during execution of the function) hold. Lastly, at the end of the implementation, check that its postcondition(s) is (/are) met; postconditions shall be chosen to be as strong as possible. \\

\subsubsection{Hoare Logic for Computer Arithmetic}
\label{sssec:HoareLogicForComputerArithmetic}

	Check if arithmetic and logical operations cause overflows or underflows \cite{Crowl2015,Crowl2012}. When faced with a constrained range for representing real numbers with bits in computer hardware, a constrained resolution such that a representation smaller than single-precision floating-point numbers is required, or low-cost and/or low-power electronic/computer systems that do not have floating-point arithmetic circuits, use a circuit-based implementation of fixed-point arithmetic.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Debugging {\it C++} Software}
\label{ssec:DebuggingCppSoftware}

	This section covers debugging syntax errors (in \S\ref{sssec:InterpretingCppCompilationErrors}) that are reported by {\it C++} compilers. It also covers semantic errors that can be discovered via software testing and formal verification tools; see \cite[\S4.4, pp. 119]{Pradhan2009}. In addition, it includes performance debugging \cite[\S4.5, pp. 119--120]{Pradhan2009}, using software profilers \cite[Figure 7.1, pp. 292; and \S7.2.10, pp. 302]{Fisher2005} \cite[pp. 148]{Kernighan1999} \cite[pp. 35-9 -- 35-10]{Lee2008b} \cite[\S3.2, pp. 16--18]{Fog2014c} \cite[\S3.3.2, pp. 21--22; pp. 23; Figure 40, pp. 102; Appendix C, \S C.1.7, pp. 104]{Baik2013} and static analysis software \cite[\S5.4, 65-66; and Figure 40, pp. 102]{Baik2013} \cite{Adve1997} \cite[\S7.1, 176--183]{Bailey2007} \cite[\S5.2.4, pp. 82--83; and \S5.4.2, pp. 90--92]{Debbabi2010} \cite[Chapter 7, pp. 109--117]{Ford2008} \cite[\S35.5, pp. 35-10 -- 35-14]{Lee2008b} \cite{Boulanger2013}. These phases cannot be highly overlapped consider by more than a significant amount.
\ \\

	To  functionally debug software with success, these four steps should be carried out: ``test input generation, error detection, error diagnosis, and error correction'' \cite{Kirovski1997}.

\subsubsection{Interpreting {\it C++} Compilation Errors}
\label{sssec:InterpretingCppCompilationErrors}

	A missing semiconlon ``;'', or lack of matching curly braces ``\}'' (or parentheses ``)'', square brackets ``]'', or angle brackets ``$>$''), can cause a lot of compilation errors \cite{Husted2000}.
