This section documents algorithms that I have implemented for my C++ -based boilerplate code repository. \\


A template for typesetting algorithms is shown in {\sc Procedure} \ref{lst:MyAlgorithm}.

\begin{codebox}
\Procname{$\proc{NAME OF THE ALGORITHM}({\it ARGUMENTS})$}
\label{lst:MyAlgorithm}
\zi \Comment {\it Input ARGUMENT \#1: Definition1}
\zi \Comment {\it Input ARGUMENT \#2: Definition2}
\li BODY OF THE PROCEDURE
\zi \Comment {\it A while loop.}
\li \While [condition]
	\Do
\li	[Something]
	\End
\zi \Comment {\it A for loop.}
\li \For \id{Var} $\gets$ [initial value] \To [final value]
	\Do
\li	[Something]
	\End
\zi \Comment {\it An if-elseif-else block.}

\li	\Return
