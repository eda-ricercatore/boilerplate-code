% This is written by Zhiyang Ong to recreate the ``68 predefined internal colors of the {\tt dvips} PostScript driver'' \cite{Kopka04}
%
%
% I have written this because I cannot get the aforementioned 68 predefined internal colors to work for any \LaTeX document on my MacBook Pro. Perhaps the \LaTeX\ setup is the cause of the problem.
% I have used the \usepackage{color} command with the ``dvipsnames'' and ``usenames'' options to no avail
% The \usepackage{color} command with the aforementioned options are added into the preamble \cite{Kopka04} and see \url{http://oregonstate.edu/~peterseb/tex/samples/color-package.html} (last viewed Monday, May 25, 2009 @ 0900 hrs PST)
% \usepackage[dvipsnames]{color}
% \usepackage[usenames]{color}
%
%
% Hence, I used a file ``dvipsnam.def'' containing the list of these 68 predefined internal colors to create the definitions of these 68 colors for use in my \LaTeX\ document(s)
